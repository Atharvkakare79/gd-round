Answer:
“I feel social media is like a double-edged sword. On one hand, it has made us more connected than ever before. With just one click, we can talk to friends and family across the world, join communities of shared interests, and even build professional networks through platforms like LinkedIn. Social media has also helped in spreading awareness about social issues and giving a voice to people who may not have had one earlier.

On the other hand, excessive use of social media is making many people isolated in real life. Instead of spending quality time face-to-face, we spend hours scrolling online. Likes and comments often replace genuine conversations, which can affect mental health and lead to feelings of loneliness.

So, in my opinion, social media itself is not good or bad—it depends on how we use it. If used wisely, it keeps us connected and informed. But if overused, it can definitely make us isolated. Balance is the key.”
