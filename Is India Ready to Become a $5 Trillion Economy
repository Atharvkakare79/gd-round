Answer:
“I believe India is on the path to becoming a $5 trillion economy, but there are both opportunities and challenges.

On the positive side, India has a young and dynamic workforce, a booming startup ecosystem, and increasing digital adoption. Initiatives like ‘Make in India’ and improved infrastructure are attracting foreign investments. The IT and service sectors are already contributing significantly to GDP growth.

However, there are hurdles to overcome. Unemployment, income inequality, and challenges in agriculture and manufacturing could slow down growth. Inflation and global economic uncertainty also play a role.

In my opinion, India can achieve this goal if it continues investing in education, skill development, technology, and infrastructure while ensuring inclusive growth. It’s ambitious, but achievable with focused policies and implementation.”
