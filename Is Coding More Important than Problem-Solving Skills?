Introduction:
In computer science, both coding and problem-solving are essential. Coding is the way we implement solutions, while problem-solving is about analyzing and designing the solution itself. The debate is whether coding alone is enough or problem-solving carries more weight.

For Coding:

Coding is the practical skill that brings ideas to life.

Without coding, even the best problem-solving ideas stay theoretical.

In industry, companies need developers who can write efficient, bug-free code.

For beginners, learning coding first builds confidence and a foundation.

For Problem-Solving Skills:

Problem-solving is the root skill of computer science.

A person who knows coding but cannot think logically or design algorithms will struggle.

Many companies test logical reasoning, data structures, and algorithms more than syntax.

Problem-solving ensures scalability, efficiency, and innovation in software.

Balanced View:

Coding and problem-solving are not rivals but complementary.

Problem-solving gives direction, and coding executes that direction.

A good computer science professional must master both to succeed.

Conclusion:
While coding is necessary to implement, problem-solving is more fundamental because it defines what to build and how to optimize it. The best approach is to develop strong problem-solving skills and then use coding as a tool to express solutions.
