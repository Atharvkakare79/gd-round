Answer:
“I think both Work From Home and Work From Office have their own advantages, and the future lies in finding the right balance.

Work From Home has given employees flexibility, saved travel time, and even improved productivity for many. It also helps companies cut costs on infrastructure. During the pandemic, it proved that most jobs, especially in IT, can be done effectively from home.

However, offices play a big role in collaboration, innovation, and building company culture. Face-to-face interactions often spark creativity and improve teamwork, which is difficult to fully achieve online. Also, freshers benefit more from office environments where they can directly learn from peers and mentors.

So instead of choosing one extreme, a hybrid model seems the best solution—some days at home for focus work, and some days at office for collaboration. This way, employees enjoy flexibility while companies maintain culture and productivity.”
