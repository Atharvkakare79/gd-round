Answer:
“I believe Artificial Intelligence is more of a boon than a bane for the future workforce. AI is already transforming industries by automating repetitive tasks, improving efficiency, and enabling smarter decision-making. For example, in healthcare, AI helps in faster diagnosis; in finance, it reduces fraud; and in customer service, chatbots improve response time.

At the same time, we cannot ignore the challenges. Many fear job losses due to automation. But history shows that every technological revolution, whether it was the industrial revolution or the IT boom, initially displaced some jobs but later created entirely new industries and opportunities. The key lies in reskilling and upskilling the workforce.

So, instead of seeing AI as a threat, we should view it as a partner that will handle repetitive work while humans focus on creativity, problem-solving, and emotional intelligence. To sum up, AI is a boon if used responsibly and if the workforce adapts to the changing demands.”
